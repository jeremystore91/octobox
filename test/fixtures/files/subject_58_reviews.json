    "body": "Looking good! I haven't tried running it end to end but have enough feedback to address first:\r\n\r\n* Regarding the Docker Hub image and how images should be tailored per-environment, I generally agree but have tried to keep it 'backwards compatible' in that we've always supported dev environments in the images we provide. However, I really do think it makes sense to the image be a production-only environment and I don't really think we want to deal with providing multiple images. I'm still learning here so if there's an easy way to do it, sure - otherwise as long as @andrew is cool with it I'm all for just providing production images on Docker Hub.\r\n* It seems like some documentation might need updating, especially with the above consideration. To give Octobox a try in development at this point you'd need to pull down the repo and make your own image anyway, so some docs should be changed and I think the override file could probably just be removed, too.  \r\n",
