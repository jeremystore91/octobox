    "body": "Oh, I just realize @chrisarcand already opened a PR today to address some of the same issues this PR fixes.\r\n\r\nThe scope of his/their PR is wider than mine, however the introduction of the multi-stage feature in this PR, as well as the systematic deletion of `build-base`  help to reduce the size of the image: while the final image from chrisarcand is ~800MB, mine is ~350MB (uncompressed). Thus, I think both are complementary."

This is better since `cache_classes` is turned to false in that env.\r\n"
